# slp-followup
This app allows a more organized follow-up of patients. 

## Description
For now this is the "first stage", I made it to put in practice what i've learned with ReactJs but I have a bigger project in mind. The app let you store info about
your patients, I made it thinking in the necessities that I had when I used to work as a Speech-language therapist. 
I made it using mainly ReactJs, I wanted to practice the use of the components, at the same time I wanted to make use of the most used Hooks at React level, which are
useState and useEffect.
And for the styles I used Tailwind CSS
